Project Summary
This project aims to classify different species of fish using a deep learning-based classification model. The dataset used contains fish images in .png format, and the goal is to develop a model capable of identifying the fish species from these images. We used an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architecture to train the classification model.

This project was developed as part of Akbank's Deep Learning Bootcamp and follows standard practices in data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and hyperparameter optimization.

Dataset
Source: Kaggle - A Large-Scale Fish Dataset
File Format: Images are in .png format.
Categories: The dataset contains several fish species, including:
Gilt-Head Bream
Red Mullet
Horse Mackerel
Shrimp
Trout
Striped Red Mullet
Red Sea Bream
Sample Images
<!-- Replace with actual image path -->

Project Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
The dataset contains images organized into folders by species. To prepare the data for the classification model:

We loaded the image paths and labels.
Created a Pandas DataFrame to store the image paths and their respective labels.
Resized images to a uniform size for model input.
Converted the images into NumPy arrays for input into the neural network.
Code Snippet:

label = []
path = []
fish_dir = '/path_to_fish_dataset'
for dir_name, _, filenames in os.walk(fish_dir):
    for filename in filenames:
        if os.path.splitext(filename)[-1] == '.png':
            if dir_name.split('/')[-1] != 'GT':
                label.append(dir_name.split('/')[-1])
                path.append(os.path.join(dir_name, filename))

data = pd.DataFrame(columns=['path', 'label'])
data['path'] = path
data['label'] = label
2. Train-Test Split
The data was split into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing) to ensure that the model could generalize well to unseen data.

3. Model Architecture
We used an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for this classification task. The architecture consists of:

Input layer to process the flattened image arrays.
Several Dense (fully connected) layers with ReLU activation.
Dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
An output layer with softmax activation for multi-class classification.
Code Snippet:

model = Sequential([
    Dense(512, activation='relu', input_shape=(image_size,)),
    Dropout(0.3),
    Dense(256, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.3),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
4. Model Training
The model was trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical_crossentropy loss function.
We used a batch size of 32 and trained the model over 20 epochs.
Training included monitoring the model's accuracy and loss to ensure it was learning properly.
Code Snippet:

history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, validation_data=(X_test, y_test), epochs=20, batch_size=32)
5. Model Evaluation
The model was evaluated on the test dataset using accuracy and loss metrics. We also used a confusion matrix to visualize the model's performance across different classes.

Code Snippet for Evaluation:
python

test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print("Test Loss: {:.5f}".format(test_loss))
print("Test Accuracy: {:.2f}%".format(test_acc * 100))
Results
Test Accuracy: The model achieved an accuracy of approximately XX% on the test set.
Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix was generated to evaluate the classification performance across species.
Confusion Matrix:

Epochs: 20
Further hyperparameter tuning can be explored to improve the model's performance.
